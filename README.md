## How Treblle Works
Once you’ve integrated a Treblle SDK in your codebase, this SDK will send requests and response data to your Treblle Dashboard.

In your Treblle Dashboard you get to see real-time requests to your API, auto-generated API docs, API analytics like how fast the response was for an endpoint, the load size of the response, etc.

Treblle also uses the requests sent to your Dashboard to calculate your API score which is a quality score that’s calculated based on the performance, quality, and security best practices for your API.

> Visit [https://docs.treblle.com](http://docs.treblle.com) for the complete documentation.

## Security

### Masking fields
Masking fields ensure certain sensitive data are removed before being sent to Treblle.

To make sure masking is done before any data leaves your server [we built it into all our SDKs](https://docs.treblle.com/en/security/masked-fields#fields-masked-by-default).

This means data masking is super fast and happens on a programming level before the API request is sent to Treblle. You can [customize](https://docs.treblle.com/en/security/masked-fields#custom-masked-fields) exactly which fields are masked when you’re integrating the SDK.

> Visit the [Masked fields](https://docs.treblle.com/en/security/masked-fields) section of the [docs](https://docs.sailscasts.com) for the complete documentation.


## Get Started

1. Sign in to [Treblle](https://app.treblle.com).
2. [Create a Treblle project](https://docs.treblle.com/en/dashboard/projects#creating-a-project).
3. [Setup the SDK](#install-the-SDK) for your platform.

### Install the SDK

```sh
go get github.com/treblle/treblle-go
```

Configure Treblle at the start of your `main()` function:

```go
import "github.com/treblle/treblle-go"

func main() {
	treblle.Configure(treblle.Configuration{
		APIKey:     "YOUR API KEY HERE",
		ProjectID:  "YOUR PROJECT ID HERE",
		KeysToMask: []string{"password", "card_number"}, // optional, mask fields you don't want sent to Treblle
		ServerURL:  "https://rocknrolla.treblle.com",    // optional, don't use default server URL
	}

    // rest of your program.
}

```

After that, just use the middleware with any of your handlers:

```go
// TODO: Add Fiber code integration example
```
